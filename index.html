                    <ol>
                        <li>Season the fish with salt on both sides then dip into flour, shaking off the excess.
                        </li>
                        <li>Whisk the eggs then pour into a shallow dish.</li>
                        <li>Heat a large frying pan until hot, then use tongs to dip the fish into the egg, completely coating the fillets on both sides.</li>
                        <li>Add the butter to the pan, allow to melt, then add the fish. Cook until golden on both sides and serve on hot plates with wedges of lemon and simple butter sauce.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Curry beans🍲</li>
                <img src="image/curry beans.jpg" height="200" width="200">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Using a sieve, drain the beans from the water that they were soaked in and rinse under running water.</li>
                        <li>On high heat, boil the beans in water for ±30 minutes or until soft. </li>
                        <li>In a large bowl, place a strainer. Remove the beans from heat, drain the water into the bowl. Do not throw water away. Place drained beans in a separate bowl.</li>
                        <li>Set both bowls aside.</li>
                        <li>In a flat pot, on medium heat, add oil and allow to heat.</li>
                        <li>Add onions, cloves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom and cumin and saute onions until golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Add ginger garlic paste, Spice Emporium Hot Curry Powder, Spice Emporium Garam Masala, turmeric powder and mix well.</li>
                        <li>Add drained beans, grated tomato, potatoes and curry leaves, mix well to coat beans and potatoes. Cook for 1 minute. </li>
                        <li>Pour in the water from the beans, mix well and stir in salt.</li>
                        <li>Increase heat, cover and allow to cook (stirring occasionally) until potatoes are soft and cooked.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Beef curry and Roti</li><img src="image/beef curry.jpg" height="200" width="200">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pour the boiling water over the flour. Use a big spoon for mixing as dough will be really hot. Mix until smooth so it will be easy to roll out (like a pie shell); grease frypan before frying.</li>
                        <li>Make them the size of taco shells. Also oil both sides of roti and fry.</li>
                        <li>Keep it warm in a covered pan or bowl while frying the remaining roti.</li>
                            <hr><Strong>Serve with curry.</Strong></hr>
                        <li>Heat the oil first. Fry the ginger, garlic and the onion until brown.</li>
                        <li>Add the salt and curry powder.</li>
                        <li>Stir for about 2 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add small cubes of beef and let it cook until the beef is tender.</li>
                        <li>Then add potato cubes.</li>
                        <li>If the meat is kind of dry, add a little water.</li>
                        <li>Also the meat and potatoes will cook better.</li>
                        <li>When curry mixture is done, put some in each roti shell (something like tacos) and <li>wrap the roti shell around the curry mixture (like a package).</li>
